LaughingLeader's Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager
=======

A mod manager for [Baldur's Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/).

**This is the only official source for the BG3 Mod Manager.** There is no "official website" beyond this repository.

# Setup

1. Run the game once if you haven't already, so a profile and the mods folders get created.
2. Make sure you have [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.15-windows-x64-installer) and [the latest C++ redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) installed.
3. [Grab the latest release.](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases/latest/download/BG3ModManager_Latest.zip)
4. The BG3 Mod Manager is portable, so extract it to a non-protected folder (don't extract it to your Program Files).
5. Upon running `BG3ModManager.exe`, pathways to the game data and exe should be automatically detected.  
*If this fails, manually set the pathways in Settings -> Preferences, click 'Save', then click the 'Refresh' button so the campaign mod data is loaded.*

6. Organize your active mods for the profile `Public`, then click the first export button (Export Load Order to Game), or click File -> Export Order to Game, to export your active load order to the game. This updates the `modsettings.lsx` file that the game reads.

# Important Tips  
* Make sure you don't have any subfolders in your mods folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods`). This causes the game to reset your `modsettings.lsx`!
* Ensure the `Game Data Path` is set in Settings -> Preferences to the game's data folder, where all the various .pak files are (Gustav.pak etc).
* Make sure you have a campaign selected (i.e. "Main"). The game must have a campaign exported to the `modsettings.lsx`, or it will fail to load the main menu scene / have other issues.
* If your `modsettings.lsx` still resets when loading into the game, this means that one or more of your mods are encountering an error, and the game is clearing the load order.

# Current Features:

* Reorganize mod load orders with a quick drag-and-drop interface. Allows reordering multiple mods at once.
  * View details about each mod, including the description and dependencies.
* Save your mod load orders to external json files for sharing or backing things up.
* Export your active mod order to various text formats (i.e. a spreadsheet). These formats will include extra data, such as the mod's steam workshop url, if any.
* Filter mods by name and properties (author, mode, etc.).
* Export load order mods to zip files (including editor mods), for easier sharing of a playthrough's mods between friends.
* Import load orders from save files.
* Shortcut buttons to all the various game-related folders (mods folder, workshop folder, game directory, etc).
* Dark and light theme support.

## Features for Mod Authors

* Extract selected mods with a few clicks. Useful for mod authors, or those wanting to study mod files for learning.
* Copy a mod's UUID or FolderName in the right click menu. Useful for if you're setting up Ext.IsModLoaded checks with the script extender, for mod support.
* You can specify custom tags in your project's meta.lsx (the "Tags" property"). Seperate tags with a semi-colon, and the mod manager will display them.
* A "Version Generator" tool is available under the Tools menu, for generating the correct number for major/minor/revision/build numbers.

# Notes

* Mod projects in the Data folder are highlighted in green. They can be used in the load order like regular mods, and even exported to zip files.
* New profiles must be made in-game. You should also run the game at least once, so all of the game's user folders are created.
* Highlight over mods to see their description and list of dependencies. Red dependencies are missing dependencies.
